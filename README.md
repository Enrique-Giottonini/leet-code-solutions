# leet-code-solutions

We solved as a team the four code assignments in JavaScript, then each one implemented all of them into one programming language. In my case it was in Java.

I also added my individual code assignments in the language I feel most comfortable with, Python.

All the code assignments were submitted as PRs to the original repo at Nearsoft.
